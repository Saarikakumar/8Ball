                  Just like the classic toy, users can ask the 8 Ball on the 'My Ball' page a question they want answered, and receive a response from the ether. Unlike the 8 Ball you've grown up with, in our application users write five 'fortunes', any of which the 8 Ball could select. Once submitted, a randomizing feature selects a response which is revealed beneath the 'click here for your fortune' button. You have a hand in your fate but ultimaly the 8 Ball knows best.

                  The Magic 8 Ball was invented by Albert Carter who was inspired by his mother, a clarivoyant. The original device was called the Syco-Seer, which took the shape of a cylinder and used two instead of one die. Abe Bookman eventually patented the device as the Magic 8 Ball.
