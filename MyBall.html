          User Documentation

          Technical
          In order to assemble our webpage, technical users must save the html, css and javascript files to their device in the same location. These are entitled MyBall.html, main.css, and 8ball.js respectively. Additional files that were used in our project include an info page (info.html), background image (colorful- galaxy.jpg), a 8-Ball outline (Circle_black_simple.svg), and an image of a magic 8 Ball (8Ballsvg.png). All these files should be stored within the same folder as the html, css, and js files are. Once all are saved in this location, the technical user can then right-click to open the MyBall.html file in any browser of their choice, and both css and javascript will already be linked to the page.

          Non-technical
          Just like the classic toy, users can ask the 8 Ball on the 'My Ball' page a question they want answered, and receive a response from the ether. In our application users write five 'fortunes' in the form provided, any of which the 8 Ball could select as a response to their question. The user then clicks ‘submit’, and after that, ‘click here for your fortune’. Immediately following this, a randomizing feature selects one response out of the five written to be displayed beneath the 'click here for your fortune' button. Your fortune has been foretold!
